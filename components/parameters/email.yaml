    When this parameter is enabled our API will not perform an SMTP check with the mail service
    provider, which greatly increases the API speed. Syntax and DNS checks are still performed
    on the email address as well as our disposable email detection service. This option is
    intended for services that require decision making in a time sensitive manner.

timeoutParam:
  in: query
  name: timeout
  description: >
    Maximum number of seconds to wait for a reply from a mail service provider. If your
    implementation requirements do not need an immediate response, we recommend bumping this
    value to 20. Any results which experience a connection timeout will return the "timed_out"
    variable as true. Default value is 7 seconds.

    Force analyze if the email address's domain has a typo and should be corrected to a popular

    if the "recent abuse" status is true.

strictnessParam:

  name: strictness
  description: >
    Sets how strictly spam traps and honeypots are detected by our system, depending on how
    comfortable you are with identifying emails suspected of being a spam trap. 0 is the lowest
    level which will only return spam traps with high confidence. Strictness levels above 0 will
    return increasingly more strict results, with level 2 providing the greatest detection
    rates.

abuseParam:

  name: abuse_strictness
  description: >
    Set the strictness level for machine learning pattern recognition of abusive email addresses
    with the "recent_abuse" data point. Default level of 0 provides good coverage, however if
    you are filtering account applications and facing advanced fraudsters then we recommend
    increasing this value to level 1 or 2.
