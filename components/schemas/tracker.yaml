    message:
      type: string
      description: >
        A string describing the output in human terms. Generally this will only have a non-empty
        value in the case of an error.
    success:
      type: boolean
      description: Status of the request.
    device_id:
      type: string
      format: SHA256 hash
      description: >
        The Device ID is generated as a hash from the user's device hardware and personal settings.
        This value can be used for tracking users, detecting duplicate accounts, or passed to our
        postback endpoint for confirmation.
    guid:
      type: string
      format: SHA256 hash
      description: >
        Hardware tracking ID which uses a different algorithm for calculating a hash of the user's
        device. This value can overlap with other devices that share the same hardware
        configuration. Please use in conjunction with "guid_confidence".
    guid_confidence:
      type: integer
      minimum: 0
      maximum: 100
      description: >
        Accuracy of the "guid" match which associates a GUID hardware profile with other users,
        where 0 = not likely, 100 = very likely. A result of 100 is a guaranteed match. Confidence
        levels below 100 use an intelligent "best guess" approach. Some "guid" results may overlap
        users, such as a device with factory settings for popular devices.
    fraud_chance:
      type: integer
      minimum: 0
      maximum: 100
      description: >
        How likely this device is to commit fraud or engage in abusive behavior. 0 = not likely,
        100 = very likely. 25 is the median result. Fraud Scores >= 75 are suspicious, but not
        necessarily fraudulent. We recommend flagging or blocking traffic with Fraud Scores >= 85,
        but you may find it beneficial to use a higher or lower threshold.
    is_crawler:

      description: >
        Is this device associated with being a confirmed crawler from a mainstream search engine
        such as Googlebot, Bingbot, Yandex, etc.

      description: >
        Classification of the IP address connection type as "Residential", "Corporate",
        "Education", "Mobile", or "Data Center".
    proxy:
      type: boolean
      description: Returns true if the lookup is on a Proxy, VPN, or Tor connection.
    vpn:
      type: boolean
      description: >
        Is this IP suspected of being a VPN connection? (proxy will always be true if this is true)
    tor:
      type: boolean
      description: >
        Is this IP suspected of being a Tor connection? (proxy will always be true if this is true)
    recent_abuse:
      type: boolean
      description: >
        This value will indicate if there has been any recently verified abuse across our network
        for this user. Abuse could be a confirmed chargeback, compromised device, fake app install,
        or similar malicious behavior within the past few days.
    bot_status:
      type: boolean
      description: >

        type: string
      description: >
        remium Account Feature - Fraud Score Insights explain how this device's Fraud Score was
        calculated and provides further detail into enhanced Fraud Scores and penalties.
        This data point is only available via the postback API so real-time users cannot reverse
        engineer why they were penalized.

      type: string
      format: SHA256 hash
      description: >
        A hash of the user's WebGL profile, calculated by the graphics card and other device
