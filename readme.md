You should now see a collection in Postman called IPQualityScore API. In order
to successfully make requests using the collection, you must have an API key. If
you do not have one, you can sign up for a free account at
[IPQualityScore.com](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/create-account)
![authorization](https://cdn.ipqualityscore.com/images/p322h8xg2ntv5qt.png)


Most of our requests allow the API key to be given in the URL path, as a query
parameter, in header, or in the body of a POST request. Regardless of which
option you choose, you will want to place the value of your API key in a
collection variable. Don't forget to click *save* once you've entered the key. ![store API key as a variable](https://cdn.ipqualityscore.com/images/dpt04rkojcaw41l.png)

You will then be able to send requests. Please contact IPQualityScore support at
